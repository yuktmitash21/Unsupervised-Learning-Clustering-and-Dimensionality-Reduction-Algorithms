# Unsupervised-Learning-Clustering-and-Dimensionality-Reduction-Algorithms

I wrote all code in Python 3.7.1 and used the scikit-learn machine learning library
to implement all algorithms. All of my code consistes of .ipynb files because I wrote them all as Jupyter notebooks.
If you would like to view the code, I have already run each cell, so just open up the
.ipynb file and see the output of each cell. If you would like to recreate my code, you will
need the following installed: Pyton 3.7.1, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib. Here are clear instructiond
for running .ipynb files: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49113264/open-ipynb-in-browser-from-command-line.
Please run all cells sequentially to avoid any errors. Below is all attribution needed:
